  Spec is a some kind of composition of arbitrary

            :field2 (string 20))

  An other example on how to create indexed
  composition that represents the same bytes
  representation that previous one:

      (spec (long) (string 20))

  The main difference between the two reprensentation
  is that if you read a buffer using an associative
  spec, the result will be clojure hash-map, and if
  indexed spec is used, the result will be clojure
  vector containing the values.

  The same rules applies for writing data into a
